RPiDS
===================
Raspberry Pi Digital Signage Software


RPiDS is a digital signage manager program designed to run on a Raspbian 
based, Raspberry Pi system to be used as a means of producing imagery for 
display. The goal of this project is to produce a flexible, user-friendly, and
cost effective alternative to professional digital signage systems of the
same type. Furthermore, this system employs a Flask-based web service that is
used to act as an interface between the user and the systems functionality.
